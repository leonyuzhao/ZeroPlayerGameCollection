* **Langton's Ant Game**

<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton''s_ant' target='_blank'>Langton's Ant</a> is based on Chris Langton's two-dimensional Turing machine game with two simple rules:

* At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
* At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit

Here's the demo: <a href='http://leonyuzhao.github.io/LangtonsAnt/' target='_blank'>Demo</a>

* **Conway's Game of Life**

<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway''s_Game_of_Life' target='_blank'>Conway's Game of Life</a> is based on John Horton Conway's zero player game with following rules:

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
